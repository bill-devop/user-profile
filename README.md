# user-profile
Builds a simple user profile with JavaScript

## inputs
Takes a name, age and color by order of request -> input using asynchronous methods. Prints a message informing the user of their newly created profile and settings. Updates background to color.

## comments
Very basic. I had a lot of trouble getting the promises to work. If I am correct, I entered callback mayhem after the introduction. I feel like this should be cleaner. Not sure how though. Please let me know if you have any comments or ideas on how it could be simplified/cleaned up further.
